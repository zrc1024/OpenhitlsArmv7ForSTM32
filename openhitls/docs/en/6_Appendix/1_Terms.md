|/|Man-in-the-Middle Attack|During a TLS handshake, the client and server negotiate security parameters such as the encryption algorithm, key exchange algorithm, and certificate authentication mode.|
|/|Secure Renegotiation|After a TLS handshake is complete, the client or server initiates a handshake process again to negotiate a new key.|
