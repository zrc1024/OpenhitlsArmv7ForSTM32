/**
 * @ingroup app
 * @brief TLS can read data of any length, not in the unit of record. DTLS can read data in the unit of record.
 * Reads num bytes from the CTX to the buffer. Users can transfer any num bytes (num must be greater than 0).
 *
 * @attention Reads only the application data decrypted by one record at a time.
 * HITLS copies the application data to the input cache.
 * If the cache size is less than 16K, the maximum size of the application message decrypted from a single record is 16K
 * This will result in a partial copy of the application data.
 * You can call APP_GetReadPendingBytes to obtain the size of the remaining readable application data in current record.
 * This is useful in DTLS scenarios.
